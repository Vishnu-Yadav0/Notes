SmokeTest

 Smoke testing is a preliminary software testing method used to verify the stability and functionality of a build before more detailed testing. Here are the key points:

Purpose:

Smoke tests reveal simple failures severe enough to reject a prospective software release.
They cover critical functionality to assess whether the main features of the software appear to work correctly.

Questions Addressed by Smoke Testing:
Basic questions include:

“Does the program run?”
“Does the user interface open?”
“Does clicking the main button do anything?”


pom.xml --> maven file

 A buildspec.yml file is a collection of build commands and related settings in YAML format used by AWS CodeBuild to run a build. 



AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service to model visualize and automate the steps required to release your software. It helps you model and configure the different stages of the software release process.

CodeCommit provides source and version control for our code.
CodeBuild deals with the steps and test phase in CD Environment.
